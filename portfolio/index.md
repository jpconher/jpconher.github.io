### Project Euler

<a href="https://projecteuler.net/" target="_blank">Project Euler</a> is a website that comprises a vast collection of mathematical problems intended to be solved with computer algorithms. 
My solutions in Python can be found in this <a href="https://github.com/jpconher/Project_Euler/">repository</a>. As a general rule, I strive to make them as computationally efficient as I can.

### Projects

Here are some projects I've worked on over the years. The topics vary, reflecting both my interests and my current job.

- [Illustration of the expected and unexpected losses under the Vasicek-Merton model](../assets/portfolio/Illustration of EL and UL under Vasicek-Merton model.pdf)
 
### Kaggle

<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/" target="_blank">Kaggle</a> serves as a platform for data science competitions. Below, you can find my solutions to several competitions:

- [Spaceship Titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/code/juanconher/spaceship-titanic-with-decision-trees)
- [House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/code/juanconher/predicting-house-price-with-linear-regression)
