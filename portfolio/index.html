<h3>Project Euler</h3>

  <p>
    <a href="https://projecteuler.net/" target=”_blank">Project Euler</a> is a website that comprises a vast collection of mathematical problems intended to be solved with computer algorithms. 
    My solutions in Python can be found in this <a href="https://github.com/jpconher/Project_Euler/">repository</a>. As a general rule, I strive to make them as computationally efficient as I can.
