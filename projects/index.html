  <h3>Project Euler</h3>
  <div align="justify";>
    <p><a href="https://projecteuler.net/" target=”_blank">Project Euler</a> is a website that comprises a vast collection of mathematical problems intended to be solved with computer algorithms. My solutions in Python can be found in this <a href="https://github.com/jpconher/Project_Euler" target=”_blank">repository</a>. As a general rule, I strive to make them as computationally efficient as I can.</p>
