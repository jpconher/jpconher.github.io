<h3>Project Euler</h3>

<div align="justify";>
  <p>Project Euler is a website that comprises a vast collection of mathematical problems intended to be solved with computer algorithms. My solutions can be found in this <a href="https://github.com/jpconher/Project_Euler">repository</a>. As a general rule, I strive to make them as computationally efficient as I can.</p>
