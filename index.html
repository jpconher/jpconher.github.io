			About me
		</h3>
		
		<p> 
			I was born and raised in the Canary Islands, a Spanish archipelago off the coast of 
			northwestern Africa. Over the past decade, my academic and professional journey has 
			taken me across Europe and Asia, fostering a deep appreciation for cultural diversity 
			and a strong sense of adaptability.
		</p>

		<p>	
			Currently, I am based in Madrid, working as a data scientist in the Risk Quant Force (RQF) 
			group at BNP Paribas. In this role, I develop statistical models and simulations to assess 
			financial risks within the bank's portfolio. Prior to this, I held similar positions at BBVA 
			and Banco Cooperativo Español, preceded by an internship as a research assistant at Banco de 
			España, Spain's central bank.  
		</p>

		<h3>
			Education
		</h3>

		<p>	
			I hold a Master's Degree in Statistics and Data Science from Katholieke Universiteit Leuven (KU Leuven) 
			in Belgium, with a specialisation in econometrics. I also earned a Bachelor's Degree in Economics from Universidad 
			Carlos III de Madrid, focusing on quantitative methods. During my studies, I participated in exchange programmes 
			at the University of Glasgow and Fudan University in Shanghai.
