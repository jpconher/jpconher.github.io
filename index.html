	<h2>Welcome to my personal website!</h2>
	<p>If you came here, it is probably because you know me or you want to know me better. In either case you have come to the right place.	Here you will find information about who I am and the projects I have been working on. If you feel even more curious about me, in the blog section you may find my personal views about anything that has caught my attention (and is worth writting on) or the books I read. Additionally, you can reach me by email or visit my social media accounts.</p>
