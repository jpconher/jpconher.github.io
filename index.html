		<h3>About me</h3>
		
		<p>My name is Juan Pablo. I was born in the island of Tenerife, Spain. After coming of age, I moved to Madrid to study my Bachelor in Economics at Universidad Carlos III de Madrid. During my undergraduate studies, I had the opportunity to spend my third year at the University of Glasgow followed by one semester at Fudan University in Shanghai during my final year. After coming back from China, I worked as intern at Banco de España (the central bank of Spain) during my last semester. Following my graduation, I moved to Leuven (Belgium) to pursue a MSc in Statistics at Katholieke Universiteit Leuven (KU Leuven). Currently, I am a second year student at this programme. </p>
		
		<p>My personal interests are broad. Naturally, I like Economics and Statistics. I believe they complement well each other since a theory without the support of data is no more than a good guess. Also, I consider myself an amateur philosopher. I enjoy very much reading classical philosophers. Among contemporary philosophers, I hold my compatriot José Ortega y Gasset in high esteem. History is also of interest to me, particularly ancient Greek and Roman history as well as Chinese history. Talking about Chinese history, one of my passions is the study of Mandarin Chinese. A bit of knowledge of this language, has brought me many joys including living in China for half a year. In my spare time, I enjoy playing tennis so if you are up for a challenge that is also another reason to reach out to me.  </p>
