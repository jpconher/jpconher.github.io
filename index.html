			About me
		</h3>
		
		<p> 
			I was born in the Canary Islands, a Spanish archipielago located off the cost of 
			Northwestern Africa, renowned for its volcanic landscapes and pleasant climate all year round. 
			At the age of 18, I made the decision to move to Madrid to pursue my Bachelor's degree in Economics 
			at Universidad Carlos III de Madrid. Throughout my undergraduate studies, I had the opportunity to spend my third year at the University 
			of Glasgow and later, a semester at Fudan University in Shanghai during my final year. Upon returning
			I embarked on an intership at Banco de España, the central bank of Spain, performing data analysis
			in Stata and literature reviews on topics ranging from digital currencies (CBDC) to price stability.
			Following my graduation, I moved to Leuven (Belgium) to pursue a MSc in Statistics at Katholieke 
			Universiteit Leuven (KU Leuven). Midway through my second year, while working on my master's thesis, 
			I returned to Madrid to start an internship in the financial risk management division of BBVA, the 
			second largest bank in Spain by market capitalisation. The intership eventually led to a full-time 
			contract as credit risk analyst in the IFRS9, Economic Capital and Regulatory Capital team.
			My primary responsibility revolves around incorporating forward-looking information, i.e. macroeconomic 
			data, into risk parameters, specifically PD and LGD.
		</p>

		<p>	
			My personal interests are broad. Naturally, I like Economics and Statistics. I believe they 
			complement well each other since a theory without the support of data remains no more than a 
			mere conjecture. Also, I consider myself an amateur philosopher. I enjoy very much reading 
			classical philosophers. Among contemporary philosophers, I hold my compatriot José Ortega y 
			Gasset in high esteem. History is also of interest to me, particularly ancient Greek and 
			Roman history as well as Chinese history. Talking about Chinese history, one of my passions 
			is the study of Mandarin Chinese. A bit of knowledge of this language, has brought me many 
			joys including living in China for half a year. In my spare time, I enjoy playing tennis so 
			if you are up for a challenge that is also another reason to reach out to me.
